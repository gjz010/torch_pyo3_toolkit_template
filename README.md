# torch_pyo3_toolkit_template

My own template combining the following:

- [Devenv](https://devenv.sh/) for managing native environment.
- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for managing python dependencies.
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) on ROCm for GPU support.
  - A set of most beloved dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
- [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/v0.23.1/) for writing Rust extension.
  - A set of most beloved dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.
